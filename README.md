# Song Timer
A web app to align your song's beat to your game's beat. This app is still new and was tested primarily with Beat Saber.

## What is this?
With this app you can time your songs/maps and export them with silence at the start to align the beat. It was mainly designed for making Beatsaber maps, but it can also be used for other rythm games.
